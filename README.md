# Made up Board Game

The purpose of the code is to create a very simple game similar to tic-tac-toe and create a computer AI that uses the minimax algorithm to get the score of a given table. Then the score of that table is hased and as a result it will be able to better determine the score in the future. The depth of the tree is not very big as a result the score will intially be 1 (netural). There is a file explaining the game and the code that is written
